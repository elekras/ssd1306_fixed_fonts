# ssd1306_fixed_fonts
I created 6 fixed fonts of type spleen for micropython and the SSD1306.
The spleen font is available at  
https://github.com/fcambus/spleen using the program.
The conversion program and driver comes from
https://github.com/peterhinch/micropython-font-to-py.
All the stuff is tested on the Raspberry Pi Pico with
MicroPython and an oled display with SSD1306.
Copy the contents of the directory testfonts to the root
of the Pi Pico filesytem and restart.
There are 5 fixed fonts:
spleen5x8.py
splenn6x12.py
spleen8x16.py
spleen12x24.py
spleen16x32.py
spleen32x64.py
The spleen32x64 is to big for the SSD1306.
Some pictures shows the fonts.
